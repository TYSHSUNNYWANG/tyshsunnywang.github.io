			<p span class="a x2"><font face="monospace">When I went to third grade, I joined the Martial arts team. I initiallu treated this team as a entertaining club. But after a year's training. It totally changed my mindset.
			<br></font></p>

			<p span class="a x2"><font face="monospace">My coach is literally my second dad. Due the fact that my mom is usually working until midnight, so I had to have my dinner by myself.
			But  as i join martial arts team, my coach always ask me to join their family to have dinner after training, then he just brought me to home. I was so thankful that he let me realize how is it feel like to have dinner with family.<br></font></p>
			
			<p span class="a x2"><font face="monospace">Not only improve my health condition, the most important of all is that it teaches my how to control my temper properly and to forgive others.
